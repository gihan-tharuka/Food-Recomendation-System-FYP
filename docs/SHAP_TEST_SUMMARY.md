# SHAP Explanations Test Summary

## Test Overview
Successfully created and executed a comprehensive test for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) functionality in the Food Recommendation System with the specific requirements:

### Test Parameters
- **Budget**: 8,000 LKR
- **Cuisine**: Chinese
- **Categories**: Main, Soup
- **Priority**: Main, Side dish
- **Time**: Evening
- **Weather**: Sunny

## Key Achievements

### ✅ 1. Data Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: Original ratings data (IDs 19-44) didn't match menu data (IDs 1298-1534)
- **Solution**: Created synthetic ratings data with proper ID alignment
- **Result**: 61 synthetic ratings across 22 Chinese menu items for 6 users

### ✅ 2. SHAP Implementation
- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Regressor trained on user-item interactions
- **Feature Engineering**: 17 features including price, time, weather, cuisine, category, and user preferences
- **Explainer**: TreeExplainer providing feature importance scores

### ✅ 3. Test Results
- **Recommendations Generated**: 10 items (5 soups, 5 main dishes)
- **Budget Utilization**: 99.6% (7,970/8,000 LKR)
- **SHAP Explanations**: Successfully generated for all 10 recommendations
- **Mathematical Consistency**: All SHAP values verified (base + sum = prediction)

## SHAP Explanations Insights

### Feature Impact Analysis
1. **Price Impact**: Lower prices generally increased recommendation scores
   - Sweet Corn Soup (Chicken Small) at 530 LKR: +0.199 SHAP impact
   - Sweet Corn Soup (Crab Small) at 750 LKR: -0.229 SHAP impact

2. **Weather Preference (Sunny)**: Positive but moderate impact (+0.003 to +0.021)
   - All recommended items were suitable for sunny weather

3. **Time Preference (Evening)**: Neutral impact (0.000)
   - All items were suitable for evening consumption

4. **User History**: Significant negative impact due to user's low average rating
   - User's average rating of 1.86 negatively influenced predictions

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
1. **`test_shap_explanations.py`** - Initial test (had data issues)
2. **`test_shap_explanations_corrected.py`** - Working test with synthetic data
3. **`test_shap_comprehensive.py`** - Final production-ready test
4. **`debug_shap.py`** - Debugging tool for SHAP initialization
5. **`shap_test_results_final.json`** - Detailed test results

### Key Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates realistic ratings aligned with menu items
- **Data Validation**: Ensures proper alignment between datasets
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests all aspects of SHAP functionality
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides clear explanations of feature impacts
- **Mathematical Verification**: Validates SHAP calculation consistency

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Test
```bash
cd "Food-Recommendation-System"
python test_shap_comprehensive.py
```

### Understanding Results
The test provides:
1. **Recommendation List**: Items recommended within budget constraints
2. **SHAP Explanations**: Why each item was recommended
3. **Feature Analysis**: How each preference influenced selections
4. **Validation Results**: Confirmation that all constraints were met

## Benefits for Users
